Automated Code Review and Feedback Platform
Overview

The Automated Code Review and Feedback Platform is a web application that allows developers to upload their code for automated review and feedback. The platform uses static analysis to detect common issues in the code and provides suggestions for improvement. It also generates detailed reports on the quality of the code, helping developers write better and cleaner code.
Features

    Upload Code for Review: Developers can upload code files and receive instant feedback on issues and potential improvements.
    Automated Analysis: The platform automatically analyzes the code for common issues like coding style, potential bugs, and code quality metrics.
    Review History: Users can view a history of all code reviews they have submitted, along with the feedback provided.
    Scalable: Supports multiple programming languages and can be expanded with additional static analysis tools.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+
    Node.js 14+
    npm (or yarn)

Setup Instructions
1. Backend Setup

    Navigate to the backend directory:

    bash

cd backend/

Install the required Python packages:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Create the database and run the backend server:

bash

    python run.py

    The server will start on http://localhost:5000.

2. Frontend Setup

    Navigate to the frontend directory:

    bash

cd frontend/

Install the required npm packages:

bash

npm install

Run the frontend development server:

bash

    npm start

    The frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Connecting Frontend and Backend

Ensure that both the backend (Flask) and frontend (React) servers are running. The React frontend will make API calls to the Flask backend at http://localhost:5000. If necessary, you can configure a proxy in the React app's package.json to route requests correctly.
API Endpoints
Code Reviews

    POST /upload_code: Upload code for review. Returns feedback on the uploaded code.
    GET /get_reviews: Retrieve all past reviews and feedback.

Future Enhancements

    Support for More Languages: Extend the platform to support static analysis for additional programming languages.
    Advanced Analysis: Integrate with more powerful static analysis tools and linters for deeper code insights.
    Integration with CI/CD: Allow integration with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated code reviews on every commit.
    User Authentication: Implement user authentication to manage review history per user securely.
