# 🖥️ Automated Code Review and Feedback Platform

Welcome to the **Automated Code Review and Feedback Platform**! This web application allows developers to upload their code for automated review and feedback. The platform uses static analysis to detect common issues in the code and provides suggestions for improvement. It also generates detailed reports on the quality of the code, helping developers write better and cleaner code.

## ✨ Features

- 📤 **Upload Code for Review**: Developers can upload code files and receive instant feedback on issues and potential improvements.
- 🔍 **Automated Analysis**: Automatically analyzes the code for common issues like coding style, potential bugs, and code quality metrics.
- 📜 **Review History**: View a history of all code reviews submitted, along with the feedback provided.
- ⚙️ **Scalable**: Supports multiple programming languages and can be expanded with additional static analysis tools.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

**Backend**:
- 🐍 **Python 3.8+**
- 🔥 **Flask** (for handling API requests)
- 🛠️ **Static Analysis Tools** (for code review)

**Frontend**:
- ⚛️ **React.js**
- 🎨 **CSS** (for styling)
